# Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ…
I bought your domain name since mine is too expensive. Let me know if you want to do anything with it!

Some ideas:
* Redirect to your Linkedin profile
* Personal blog
* Site about you and your interests
* Resin art gallery
* Create an email address so you don't have to spell "B E R K **E** L **E** Y" anymore
